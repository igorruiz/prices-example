# Prices-example
Example about prices for products using:
* Hexagonal Architecture Approach (not pure, as creating all modules for such a small example does not follow KISS principle).
* Three-layer (Controller - Service - Repository) architecture.
* Api First Approach.
* DDD and TDD (not pure/strict TDD).
* Clean Code and Good Programming Principles.

# Technologies used
* Open Api 3.0.
* Spring Boot 2.7.5
* Lombok.

# Possible improvements
* Reactive Approach using Spring Webflux.
* Refactor to create more modules (Adapters for instance, but followed KISS principle).
* Use 4 layers (Controller -> Use Case -> Service -> Repository) instead of 3.
